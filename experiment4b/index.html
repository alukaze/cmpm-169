                    <p>Precedurally generated magma. Inspired by various images of magma, I tried to imitate the streaks of magma as if it were flowing. </p>
                </div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I utilize a combination of procedural generation algorithms to create a dynamically evolving virtual landscape. This experiemnt also uses hashing that the user can manipulate to get different seeds of their choice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was really rough for me. I am satisfied with how it looks but I was unable to get my animations/3d effect to work and I am quite bummed out about it.</p>
